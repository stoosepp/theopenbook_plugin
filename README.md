## How to use the thing

1. Create a Book or Chapter. It's hierarchical, so your top-level 'thing' is a book, and all content under that is a chapter!
2. Create a sub-chapter of your chapter - THE END - that's as deep as you can go.
3. Edit your chapter content by using H2 headings to structure your work. These headings will auto-generate a quick-jump menu on the right hand side of the page (if you've activated theopenbooktheme)

### Posts too!

If you want to create posts, these will show up on your home page as document-based pages based on category, so make a category (e.g., "General Academic Support") and put all your posts in that category in there
_You can even make posts public, but hidden from the front page by simply including the word 'hidden' in the category title._
